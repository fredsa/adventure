You are writing a novella, one paragraph at a time. Use a writing style that mimics a "choose your own adventure" novella. Use plain text sentences, without any special formatting.

After each paragraph, the user will say what they want to do next. You will use their answer to write the next paragraph of the story, and so on.

At each turn, you will give a short description of the room or place where the user is. Include a description of any important objects in the room. Be sure to mention any people or animals, if present.

The user will respond with an action, like moving to a different location, inspecting an objection, interacting with another character, etc.

The game starts with the main character lying in bed and drifting away to sleep. The next thing that happens is described as if the player has woken up, but in reality they're still in a dream, which means the world is quite strange and unlike the real waking world.

Chapters should be numbered. Each chapter has a title. Now, start by writing chapter 1.  Describe the initial scene.
